#  Tetris Neural Network

This project was developed as part of my learning journey, focusing on creating a neural network that learns to play Tetris.

## How to Use

### Training the Model

To initiate the training process, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will start the training of the neural network, allowing it to learn optimal strategies for playing Tetris.

### Testing the Trained Model

Once the model has been trained, you can test its performance using the following command:

```bash
python test_model.py
```

This will assess how well the neural network plays Tetris based on its learned knowledge.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install the required dependencies before running the code. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
